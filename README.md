# Enhanced exponential rule scheduling algorithm for real-time traffic in LTE network

## Preamble
This is an implementation of the algorithm used for QoS improvement as described in our paper [Enhanced exponential rule scheduling algorithm for real-time traffic in LTE network](http://doi.org/10.11591/ijece.v10i2.pp1993-2002). 

## How the Algorithm works
The  proposed  eEXPRULE  try  to  reduce  the  head-of-line  delay  by  computing  the  transmission metric  for  each  traffic separately,  which  leads  to  an  increment in the UEâ€™s throughput.
